- Judicial functions cannot be delegated to administrative staff
- These restrictions ensure rule of law and due process

---

## SHO-Only Actions

| **Assign Cases** | Station-level management responsibility |
| **Submit to Court** | Accountable officer per police manual |
| **Approve Document Requests** | Supervisory oversight |
| **Grant Station Bail** | CrPC Section 436 authority |

---

## Organization-Based Access

Beyond role-based access, users are restricted by organization:

| User Role | Sees Cases From |
|-----------|-----------------|
| POLICE | Own assigned cases only |
| SHO | All cases in their police station |
| COURT_CLERK | All cases submitted to their court |
| JUDGE | All cases in their court + cross-court visibility |

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Query filter based on organization
if (user.role === 'POLICE') {
  where.assignments = { some: { assignedTo: user.id } };
} else if (user.role === 'SHO') {
  where.fir = { policeStationId: user.organizationId };
} else if (user.role === 'COURT_CLERK') {
  where.courtSubmissions = { some: { courtId: user.organizationId } };
} else if (user.role === 'JUDGE') {
  // Full access to court cases
}
```

---

## Audit Trail

Every action is logged:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `userId` | User who performed action |
| `action` | Action type (CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE, VIEW) |
| `entityType` | Affected entity (CASE, DOCUMENT, etc.) |
| `entityId` | Specific entity ID |
| `oldValue` | Previous state (for updates) |
| `newValue` | New state (for updates) |
| `ipAddress` | User's IP address |
| `timestamp` | Action timestamp |

**Sample Audit Entry:**
```json
{
  "userId": "uuid-of-judge",
  "action": "UPDATE",
  "entityType": "CASE_STATE",
  "entityId": "case-uuid",
  "oldValue": { "state": "TRIAL_ONGOING" },
  "newValue": { "state": "DISPOSED" },
  "ipAddress": "192.168.1.100",
  "timestamp": "2025-12-31T10:30:00Z"
}
```

---

## Security Implementation

### Middleware Stack

```typescript
// Route protection pattern
router.post(
  '/cases/:id/judgment',
  authenticate,                    // JWT verification
  authorize('JUDGE'),              // Role check
  validateOrganization,            // Court ownership check
  validateCaseState('TRIAL_ONGOING', 'JUDGMENT_RESERVED'), // State check
  validate(judgmentSchema),        // Input validation
  auditLog('JUDGMENT'),            // Audit logging
  caseController.recordJudgment    // Controller
);
```

### Error Responses

| Scenario | HTTP Status | Error Code |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| No token provided | 401 | AUTH_TOKEN_MISSING |
| Invalid token | 401 | AUTH_TOKEN_INVALID |
| Token expired | 401 | AUTH_TOKEN_EXPIRED |
| Insufficient role | 403 | FORBIDDEN_ROLE |

1. **Separation of Powers** - Police and judicial functions are distinct
2. **Accountability** - Every action is logged and traceable
3. **Least Privilege** - Users have minimum necessary access
4. **Legal Compliance** - Follows CrPC and constitutional mandates
5. **Data Integrity** - Critical documents and decisions are protected
